# Random Python Scripts

Just some random python scripts I've written for various purposes.

## grabfiles.py

Inspired by the source for keepgrabbing.py found here: https://github.com/sprky0/jstor. Just for practice using subprocess and urllib to pull files from the web.

## passwords.py

A script for generating and validating passwords. Coded for a python web scripting class.

## passwordstest.py

Simple test for passwords.py
